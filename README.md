# LanguageLens 

Welcome to the LanguageLens project! The purpose of this project is to build a text classification model that can identify different frames used in newspaper articles. Specifically, we are interested in whether we can develop a model that can recognize harmful language in newspaper articles about domestic abuse. 

To build this model, we will create and apply an annotation scheme centred around harmful language and frames in the context of German domestic abuse newspaper articles.
